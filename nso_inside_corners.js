/* ============================================================
   NSO inside corners — the corners8 setback, taken into a pocket
   no ES modules, browser-global like the rest of the app

   What this is for
   ----------------
   corners8 (`rawVertexBallCorners`, app-finish.js) rounds the four
   vertices and four perimeter edges of ONE clicked face with the
   setback blend: the blend tapers to nothing at the face and again
   at depth R, so nothing stands proud and there is no shelf stub.
   It is an outer-hull recipe. This module gives a pocket's interior
   the same treatment.

   Why there is no concave version of the setback maths in here
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Because there does not need to be, and writing one would be wrong.
   Measured, not assumed (numbers in docs/INSIDE-CORNERS.md):

   - `rawVertexBallCorners` is subtractive by construction. It clips
     the cap face and both walls back and stitches the blend into the
     volume it removed; nothing in it can emit surface OUTSIDE the
     original faces. Rounding a CONCAVE corner adds material. So the
     operation is not a sign flip, it is the other direction entirely.
   - It also refuses concavity outright, at the first gate:
     `if (turn[ai] * wind <= 0) { skipped++; continue; }` drops any
     corner whose turn opposes the loop winding, and the all-or-nothing
     rule below it then throws for the whole face.
   - And its blend is a TWO-edge construction. `b.tip3 = b.at(0,0,R)`
     is "the knife end": the blend runs down to a point on the depth
     edge where the two walls meet, and that edge is left sharp. A
     corner with three rounded edges has no such point to close on.

   So the pocket is reached the way the shipped inside1..inside3 path
   already reaches it: run the UNMODIFIED convex engine on the plug —
   the box that was cut out — and let the boolean mirror it inward.
   The engine only ever sees the convex body it was written for.

   Relationship to the shipped pocket wrap
   ---------------------------------------
   This does not replace or compete with `wrapPocketsInPlace` /
   `nsoWrapBrick`. Those regenerate both boxes through `rawWrapSolid`,
   which rounds ALL twelve edges of the pocket ('fillet') or its eight
   vertices with the mid-edges square ('corners'). This is the third
   shape: the floor's four vertices and four floor edges carry the
   setback, and the four vertical wall edges stay square — which is
   what corners8 does on the outside and what neither wrap mode can
   express.

   The paint skip list
   -------------------
   PAINT SCOPE: SUB-REGION — this pocket's own floor and its four
   walls. Paint elsewhere on the piece (a different pocket, the outer
   hull, this pocket's mouth) does NOT stand this down, because the
   treatment provably never reaches those faces: only the plug's
   floor end is baked, and the mouth end is pushed clear of the hull.
   That is the sub-region half of the scoping rule in docs/HANDOFF.md,
   and it is a different scope from Smooth / Repair / Fusion — which
   are whole-piece and stand down on any paint at all — not a laxer
   reading of the same rule. Do not "fix" one to match the other.

   Standing rule, owner's decision: a painted / excluded face stays
   untouched by ANY bake mechanism, not only the one the paint system
   shipped with. So `opts.skip` is required, not optional, and this
   bake stands down and names the face rather than treating one that
   was painted out. mask6's own logic is read, never re-derived — the
   grid handed in is the one `brickSkipLists` already produces.

   The lid rim stays sharp for the same reason it does in the shipped
   path, and by the same mechanism: the plug is pushed 2R+1 past its
   own mouth, so the treated end is the pocket FLOOR and the mouth end
   of the plug sits outside the hull entirely. The rim goes on being
   the edge the hull face makes with the wall. Nothing here reaches
   into that rule.
   ============================================================ */

/* Soup convention, same as the rest of NSO: a flat array of floats,
   9 per triangle (3 verts x xyz), no index buffer. */

/* How far past its own mouth the plug is pushed, in units of R. Same
   figure the shipped wrap uses (`over = 2 * R + 1`), for the same
   reason: whatever the treatment does to that end has to land clear
   of the hull face, or it would round the rim. */

/* Edge health, counted on DIRECTED edges.

   `nsoSealScore` (app-finish.js) welds by coordinate rounding and counts
   undirected edges, so a backwards-wound face pairs every edge and reads
   0 open / 0 non-manifold while the surface is inside out. That is the
   hole HANDOFF.md records against `NSO_edgeStats` and
   `rawCheckWatertightQuick`, and it is not theoretical here: the
   corners-only engine's plug bake scores 0/0 on it and is still refused
   by the kernel as "Not manifold" — it carries 72 inconsistently wound
   triangles. Counting directed edges sees that: on a consistently wound
   closed surface every directed edge appears exactly once, and its
   reverse exactly once.

   Returns { open, nm, stacked }: `stacked` is the count of directed
   edges used more than once, which is the backwards-wound signature. */
