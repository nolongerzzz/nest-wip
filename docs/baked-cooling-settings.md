# Baked cooling settings (3MF export)

NSO can export the nested plate as a Bambu Studio project (`.3mf`) with the
cooling / overhang-fan settings already baked in, so the plate arrives in Bambu
Studio with the right fan behaviour instead of the user re-entering it per job.

- **Format** at the top of the Export card picks STL or 3MF for both export
  buttons and the right-click **Export** item, and relabels them.
- With 3MF selected, **Export plate** writes the whole nested plate as one
  project (one object per placed piece) and **Download selected** writes the
  active model alone as a one-object project, set down centred on the current
  plate and resting on z = 0.
- **Cooling profile** (shown only for 3MF) selects which set of values gets
  baked in; both routes bake the same `project_settings.config`.
- Both selections are remembered in `localStorage` between sessions
  (`nso.exportFormat`, `nso.coolingProfile`).

This is the *baked / global settings* path. Per-object or per-material overrides
via G-code post-processing (the "advanced mode" Grispr approach) are out of scope
here and are tracked separately.

## Where the settings live

Inside the `.3mf` (a ZIP archive):

```
[Content_Types].xml
_rels/.rels
3D/3dmodel.model                    core 3MF geometry, millimetres, Z up
Metadata/project_settings.config    <- the baked cooling settings
Metadata/model_settings.config      Bambu object / plate names
Metadata/nso_profile.json           NSO provenance (which profile, tuned or not)
```

`Metadata/project_settings.config` is JSON. NSO writes **only** the confirmed
cooling keys into it — nothing invented. Bambu Studio merges those over whatever
preset is selected when the project opens. NSO's own bookkeeping deliberately
lives in a separate `nso_profile.json` part, because Bambu warns about keys it
does not recognise in `project_settings.config`.

## The format, exactly as Bambu ships it

Both rules below were confirmed against a real Bambu Studio export using the
stock **Bambu PLA Basic @BBL A1M** profile. They are reproduced verbatim and
must not be "cleaned up".

**1. Every value is a single-element array of strings.** Not a scalar, not a
number:

```json
"overhang_fan_threshold": ["50%"]
```

**2. Percent-bearing fields keep the literal `%`; plain numeric fields do not** —
even where the number semantically *is* a percentage. `overhang_fan_speed` is
`"100"` and `fan_max_speed` is `"80"`, with no `%`, while `overhang_fan_threshold`
is `"50%"`. This is Bambu's own inconsistency. Normalising either way is a bug:
Bambu Studio's parser expects each field as it ships it.

`KEY_FORMATS` in `nso-cooling-profiles.js` encodes rule 2 per key, and
`validateValues()` runs on every export, so a future tuned profile cannot
silently add or drop a `%`.

## The locked default

`nso-cooling-profiles.js` → `DEFAULT_VALUES`, frozen, in the same key order the
real file uses so a text diff against an untouched Bambu export lines up:

| key | value | format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enable_overhang_bridge_fan` | `1` | bool |
| `overhang_fan_threshold` | `50%` | percent |
| `overhang_threshold_participating_cooling` | `95%` | percent |
| `overhang_fan_speed` | `100` | number (no `%`) |
| `pre_start_fan_time` | `2` | number |
| `reduce_fan_stop_start_freq` | `1` | bool |
| `slow_down_for_layer_cooling` | `1` | bool |
| `fan_min_speed` | `60` | number |
| `fan_cooling_layer_time` | `80` | number |
| `fan_max_speed` | `80` | number (no `%`) |
| `slow_down_layer_time` | `6` | number |
| `slow_down_min_speed` | `20` | number |
| `no_slow_down_for_cooling_on_outwalls` | `0` | bool |
| `cooling_slowdown_logic` | `uniform_cooling` | enum |

## Adding a tuned profile

Profiles are a lookup table, not a hardcoded object. Each one is
`DEFAULT_VALUES` plus its own `overrides`, so an untuned slot exports
byte-identical to `default` until someone fills it in.

Current slots:

| id | state |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | confirmed stock values, locked |
| `breakaway-support` | reserved, untuned |
| `fine-detail` | reserved, untuned |
| `high-flow` | reserved, untuned |

To tune a slot, edit `nso-cooling-profiles.js` only:

```js
'breakaway-support': {
  id: 'breakaway-support',
  label: 'Breakaway support',
  note: 'Measured on the Sept breakaway-support test prints.',
  tuned: true,
  overrides: {
    overhang_fan_speed: '80',    // number -> no '%'
    overhang_fan_threshold: '25%' // percent -> keeps '%'
  }
}
```

Nothing else needs changing — the selector, the exporter and the validator all
read that table. Run `node tools/validate-3mf.js` afterwards; it will reject an
override that breaks the `%` contract, names a key outside the confirmed set, or
fails to survive the round trip.

## Validation

```
npm run 3mf:roundtrip   # tools/3mf-test/roundtrip-check.js   - no browser, no network
npm run 3mf:drive       # tools/3mf-test/export-drive-check.mjs - real app, headless Chromium
```

Both are part of `npm test`.

**`roundtrip-check.js`** exports a real `.3mf` through the same modules the app
uses, then reads the archive back with an **independent** ZIP reader (Node
`zlib`, walking the central directory rather than trusting the writer's own
bookkeeping) and asserts, for every profile in the table:

- the archive passes third-party `unzip -t`
- every OPC part is present
- every value is a single-element array of one string
- the exact key set and order survived
- every value is byte-exact, `%` included
- the raw file text carries each key verbatim as `"key": ["value"]`, so a
  tolerant JSON parser cannot mask a formatting slip
- `project_settings.config` holds only the confirmed cooling keys
- geometry survived into `3D/3dmodel.model`
- the same input produces byte-identical archives
- the format guard really does reject a dropped `%`, an added `%`, and an
  unknown key

That is 56 checks. It is dependency-free and needs no browser.

**`export-drive-check.mjs`** covers what the Node check cannot reach: the
`<script>` tags, the Format and profile selectors, the button wiring, and
`buildPlacedObjects3MF()` / `buildActiveModelObject3MF()` turning real pieces
into 3MF objects. It loads the real `index.html` in headless Chromium, checks
the Format selector (STL default, relabelling, cooling row, persistence across a
reload), imports `fixtures/box-20mm.stl` through the app's own `handleFiles`,
clones it so the plate carries two pieces, presses **Export plate** with Format
= 3MF, presses **Download selected** with Format = 3MF (accepting the filename
prompt), presses **Export plate** again with Format = STL, captures each actual
browser download, and then takes the two `.3mf` files apart off the browser
entirely — every cooling value read back out of each archive, the plate file
holding one object per piece and the selected-model file exactly one, plus the
plate-coordinate assertions (nothing negative, nothing off the 180 mm plate,
resting on `z = 0`, the selected model centred). That is 63 checks. It does not
press **Optimize plate**, which throws on this branch (see `HANDOFF.md`).

Confirmed by hand on 2026-09-15 with a real library part as well
(`library/box_hull_80x40x20.stl`, both buttons, Format = 3MF): `unzip -t`
clean, 14 keys in table order with byte-exact values, one object of 8 vertices /
12 triangles, bounding box 50..130 x 70..110 x 0..20 on the 180 mm plate.

Like the CTH browser checks, it serves three from the `three` devDependency
rather than the CDN `index.html` names, so it needs no network. On a runner
whose Chromium predates the installed Playwright, point it at the browser:

```
CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome npm run 3mf:drive
```

## Known limitation: "Use Modified Value of Filament Preset"

**Confirmed by testing. Documented, not solved.**

If the user swaps filament profiles in Bambu Studio *after* opening an NSO
export, Bambu shows a **"Use Modified Value of Filament Preset"** dialog. It
offers to keep or discard the values that differ from the newly selected preset.

Choosing **"Discard Modified Value" loses the baked cooling settings.** The plate
then prints with the new preset's stock cooling, silently, with no further
warning.

This is inherent to how Bambu Studio reconciles a project's settings against a
preset; a 3MF cannot opt out of it. Guidance for users:

- Pick the filament profile **before** opening the NSO export, not after.
- If the dialog does appear, choose **"Use Modified Value"** to keep NSO's
  cooling settings.
- `Metadata/nso_profile.json` inside the export records which profile was baked
  in, so a plate that came out wrong can be checked after the fact.

## Verifying in Bambu Studio

The one leg of validation that cannot run here. Everything above is checked
automatically; **whether Bambu Studio itself honours the baked values needs a
machine with Bambu Studio on it.** Until someone does this, treat the feature as
working-but-unconfirmed.

Produce a file with **Export plate 3MF**, or run `npm run 3mf:drive` and use the
`.3mf` it saves. Open it in Bambu Studio, then read
**Filament settings → Cooling** and compare against the table below.

| key in the file | Cooling tab field (wording varies by version) | should read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enable_overhang_bridge_fan` | Force cooling for overhangs / bridges | on |
| `overhang_fan_threshold` | Overhang cooling threshold | 50% |
| `overhang_threshold_participating_cooling` | Overhang threshold participating cooling | 95% |
| `overhang_fan_speed` | Overhang / bridge fan speed | 100% |
| `pre_start_fan_time` | Pre-start fan time | 2 s |
| `reduce_fan_stop_start_freq` | Keep fan always on | on |
| `slow_down_for_layer_cooling` | Slow printing down for better layer cooling | on |
| `fan_min_speed` | Fan speed — min | 60% |
| `fan_max_speed` | Fan speed — max | 80% |
| `fan_cooling_layer_time` | Layer time, max fan speed threshold | 80 s |
| `slow_down_layer_time` | Layer time, slow down threshold | 6 s |
| `slow_down_min_speed` | Min print speed | 20 mm/s |
| `no_slow_down_for_cooling_on_outwalls` | Don't slow down outer walls | off |
| `cooling_slowdown_logic` | Cooling slowdown logic | uniform cooling |

Field labels move between Bambu Studio versions; the key names in
`project_settings.config` are the stable identity. Match on the value.

**Do not read the speed fields as coercion.** `overhang_fan_speed`,
`fan_min_speed` and `fan_max_speed` are stored bare (`"100"`, `"60"`, `"80"`)
and Bambu's UI renders them with a `%` sign. A UI showing `100%` for a stored
`"100"` is correct and expected — that is the inconsistency described above,
not a value being rewritten.

What would count as a real failure:

- a field shows the **stock preset value** instead of the one in the table —
  the file was parsed but that key was ignored;
- **every** field shows stock values — the file was very likely not read as a
  settings source at all (see below);
- a value is **rounded, rescaled or retyped** (`50%` arriving as `50`, `6` as
  `6.0`, `uniform_cooling` falling back to another mode) — genuine coercion.

**The most likely failure mode, if there is one.** NSO writes only the 14
confirmed cooling keys. A `project_settings.config` written by Bambu Studio
carries hundreds, including preset identity (`filament_settings_id`,
`print_settings_id`, `printer_settings_id`) and a `version`. That was a
deliberate choice — inventing values for keys nobody has confirmed is worse than
omitting them — but it is untested. If Bambu ignores the whole file, that
envelope is the first thing to add, and it is an additive change: the 14 keys
and their formats stay exactly as they are.

Record the outcome here when it is done.

## 3MF import

`nso-3mf-read.js`, wired into `handleFiles()` in `app-core.js`. **Geometry
only.** The picker and drop zone take `.3mf` alongside `.stl`; each build item
in the file becomes one model, in millimetres, Z up, with every component and
item transform applied, so the object lands where the slicer that wrote the
file had it. The same ingest path (`addModelFromZUpGeometry`) then does what it
does for an STL: raw triangles kept in file axes for Cut / Sculpt, display copy
rotated and centred. Nothing else in the archive is read - not
`project_settings.config`, not materials, colours, thumbnails or G-code.

What the reader handles, each pinned by a check:

- OPC root relationship -> model part (falls back to `3D/3dmodel.model`)
- 3MF core: `<object><mesh>`, `<components>` (nested, transforms composed),
  `<build><item transform>`; items with no transform stay put
- Production extension: `p:path` on `<component>` and `<item>`, so Bambu
  Studio's and PrusaSlicer's split `3D/Objects/*.model` parts resolve
- units (`micron` .. `foot`) scaled to mm; mirroring transforms flip the
  winding back outward; `type="other"` objects (Bambu modifiers / negative
  volumes) skipped with a console warning
- names: Bambu's `Metadata/model_settings.config`, else the first
  `<object name>` down the chain, else the file name
- ZIP: stored and deflate entries (`DecompressionStream`), ZIP64 markers,
  data descriptors; encrypted, ZIP64-only-huge and other methods refused with
  a message

Out of scope for this first pass, deliberately: per-object print settings,
paint / colour / material data, `<triangleset>` and beam lattices, multi-plate
projects (all plates' items import onto one plate), G-code-only `.gcode.3mf`
without a model part, and reading the cooling keys back out of an NSO export
(the export side owns that format; the reader never looks at it).

Tested against, all read back with the canonical checker
(`tools/stl_watertight_check.py --odd --degen`) clean and wound outward:

- **Bambu Studio's own files** in `fixtures/3mf/` (see its README): a
  production-extension file with a non-uniform item scale, and an older
  inline-mesh file with ten objects, material-extension colour groups and
  ZIP64 markers. Triangle counts, names and sizes are asserted against the
  raw XML via third-party `unzip`, never against the reader.
- **A MakerWorld project saved by BambuStudio-02.07.01.62** (two rotated
  objects, 21,694 + 21,386 triangles): names and counts match its
  `model_settings.config`, both rest on z = 0 and sit inside the plate. Not
  committed (MakerWorld licence); `NSO_3MF_REAL=/path/to/it npm run 3mf:import`
  runs it. Through the real app it loads as two models of 39.99 x 39.99 x 52
  and 34.97 x 34.97 x 50 mm, both placed.
- **NSO's own exports**: four STL fixtures -> `nso-3mf.js` -> reader, corner
  for corner within 1e-4 mm, same bounding box, same watertight verdict; and in
  the real app, an imported Bambu cube exported with **Download selected 3MF**
  and re-imported comes back corner for corner.

```
npm run 3mf:import        # tools/3mf-test/import-check.js        - 55 checks, +8 with NSO_3MF_REAL
npm run 3mf:import-drive  # tools/3mf-test/import-drive-check.mjs - 21 checks, real app, headless Chromium
```

Both are in `npm test`.

## Settled

**The container is JSON, with `:`.** Confirmed by the owner — the keys were
originally pulled out with `json.load()`, which only succeeds on valid JSON. The
`key = ["value"]` form the values were first transcribed in was shorthand, not
the file's syntax. `serializeProjectSettings()` is correct as written; no change
needed.
